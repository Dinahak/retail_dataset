## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Imported and prepared multiple CSVs for training and testing.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – Identified key relationships (e.g., product vs. competitor price correlation = **0.94**).  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Addressed multicollinearity and standardized numerical features.  
4. **Model Building** – Trained multiple predictive models:  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Lasso Regression  
   - Generalized Additive Model (GAM)  
   - Deep Neural Network (TensorFlow)  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compared models using R² and RMSE metrics to select the best-performing predictor.
